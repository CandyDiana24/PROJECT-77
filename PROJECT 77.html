<p>One meaning of system console, computer console, root console, operator's console, or simply console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, particularly those from the BIOS or boot loader, the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger. It is a physical device consisting of a keyboard and a screen, and traditionally is a text terminal, but may also be a graphical terminal. System consoles are generalized to computer terminals, which are abstracted respectively by virtual consoles and terminal emulators. Today communication with system consoles is generally done abstractly, via the standard streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr), but there may be system-specific interfaces, for example those used by the system kernel</p>
<p>Console screen is used since it helps us to learn more about Javascript and helps us learn data.
    <br>
Data can be pasted on console screen by using the console.log. FOR EX- var First_name = " Ron";
                                                               console.log(first_name) </p>
<body>
<h1>Open Console</h1>

<script>

var first_name =  "Ranbir";
console.log(first_name); 

var last_name = "Kapoor";
console.log(last_name); 

var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
console.log(full_name);

var a = "10";
console.log(a);

var b = "5";
console.log(b); 

var add = a + b;
console.log(add);
  
</script>
